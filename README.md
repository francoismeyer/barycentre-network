#### This software implements the algorithm described in arXiv:2502.00038
<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00038"> "The Best Soules Basis for the Estimation of a spectral Barycentre Network"</a> 

HOW TO USE THE SOFTWARE
In MATLAB, type
```
>> barycentreSchool(330, 455, 40);
```
to analyse the afternoon of the elementary school data. Type
```
>> barycentreSchool(5, 175, 40);
```
to analyse the morning of the elementary school data
```

To duplicate Figs. 3 and 4 in the paper, in MATLAB, type
```
>> barycentreSBM (512, 4, 0, 0, 1);
```
