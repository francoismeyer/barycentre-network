%%_Module_Name : topdown
%%
%%_Description : explores the binary tree of Soules bases, from the top (coarsest)
%%               level, down to the finest level. The function computes the best Soules
%%               basis , which provides the sparest expansion of the matrix A.
%%
%%               The core function is buildvector that constructs a new Soules vector, based
%%               on entries in r1, and the geometry in the Soules tree that is being split.
%%
%%               Input:
%%                       A the sample mean adjacency matrix, of size nNodes x nNodes
%%                       r1 first Soules vector: nonnegative vector; typically r1 = n^{-1/2} one
%%               Output:
%%                       Qn  orthogonal matrix to store all the basis vectors 
%%                           only nNodes - 1 columns are non zero in Qn; the
