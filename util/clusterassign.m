%%_Module_Name : clusterassign
%%
%%_Description : multiway spectral  assignment using pivoted QR
%% decomposition. We use the implementation of [1], which is based on
%% [2], which is based on the original idea in [3].
%%              
%%
%% 
%% INPUT:
%%
%%    V is n x nc and columns are the eigenvectors of the normalized
%%    Laplacian by increasing eigenvalues.
%%
%% OUTPUT
%%    label returns the cluster assignment vectors, associated to each of
%%    the n nodes.

function [label] = clusterassign (V)

  X = V';
  
  %% number of requested clusters

  nc = size (X,1);

  %% compute the QR decomposition of X with column pivoting
  %% U is nc x nx, and R is nc x m, Pi is n x n.

  [U, R, Pi] = qr (X);   %% X * Pi = U * R


  %%  permute the column of X and compute its polar decomposition 
  %%
  %% we have X * Pi = [Z1|Z2], so Z1 = X * Pi(:,1:nc)
  %%
  %% Pi0 is n x nc
  
  Pi0 = Pi(:,1:nc);
  
  Z1 = X * Pi0;			        %% Z1 is nc x nc
  
  %% SVD of Z1 = UZ1 * SZ1 * VZ1^T
  
  [UZ1, SZ1, VZ1] = svd(Z1);

  Q0 = UZ1 * VZ1';		        %% nc x nc permutation

  Psi = X' * Q0;		        %% permute the eigenvectors
  Psi = abs(Psi);
  
  [maxrow, label] = max(Psi, [], 2);	%% returns the maximum absolute value of each row into the vector label
