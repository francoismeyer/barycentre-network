%%_Module_Name :
%%
%%_Description : Generate one random sample from an SBM model.
%%               The function handles two geometries:
%%               1) an unbalanced model with 4 blocks: this model is trigerred by equalSize = 0
%%               2) a balancd model of M blocks; this model is trigerred by equalSize = 1
%%               All models can have arbitrary sizes (number of nodes).
%%               The edge probability is of the form O(log^2 (n)/n) for the edge probability in a 
%%               community, and O(log(n)/n) for edges between communities.
%%
%%               Input:
%%                      n: graph size
%%                      M: number of blocks
%%                      equalSize: 1 if balanced SBM
%%                      equalChance: 1 if same edge probability in all the blocks
%%
%%               Output:
%%                      P: edge probability matrix: n x n
%%                      p: =[p1,..,pM,q]
%%                      sizeofBlock = n/M
